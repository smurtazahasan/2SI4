Lab 1 and 2:
The range of integers that can be represented in Java using a primitive data type is only from −263 to 263 − 1. What if we need to manipulate integer values beyond this range?

In this assignment I wrote a HugeInteger class which was able to represent arbitrarily large integer numbers. This class implemented arithmetic operations on integers such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and comparison. I had to implement this class without using Java predefined classes, unless specified otherwise.

Additionally, I had to measure experimentally the running times of the operations implemented in my HugeInteger class and compare them with the measured running times of the corresponding operations provided by java.math.BigInteger class.
